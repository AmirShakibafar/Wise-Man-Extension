## Features

- **Animated Character**: The Wise Man walks in your editor sidebar, adding a lively, visual element to your coding environment.
- **Wisdom Sharing**: Each time you click on Wise Man, he shares a different wise sentence to inspire, motivate, or make you think.
- **Randomized Quotes**: A variety of wise quotes and sentences are preloaded so you can enjoy a new nugget of wisdom each time.
- **Reminders** : 

    `Eyes Reminder`: Every 20 minutes, the Wise Man reminds you that you've been working for too long and that it may hurt your eyes.

    `Time To Stand Reminder` : This reminder is excellent for those who work for long periods without movement. The Wise Man will remind you every 90 minutes to stand up.

    `Water Drink Reminder` : reminds you to drink enough water. Proper hydration keeps your skin healthy because developers often forget to drink water while working.
